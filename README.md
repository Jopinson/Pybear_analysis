# Pybear_analysis
## Overview of Project
I was tasked by the engimatic V. Isualize to create a summary dateframe the ride-sharing data by city type and create a graph that shows the weekly fares for each city type.
## Results

This summary dataframe is based on the year 2019. Both suburban and urban city types are doing very well, while rural struggles.

The PyBer fare summary shows roughly the same results. Rural drivers are not producing nearly as much cash as urban and suburban.
## Suggested Actions 
In order to maximize profits I think it would be best to decrease the number of drivers in rural areas. Less drivers means less money we pay out increasing our profits marginally. Second, add in a Pyber Pool option, that would allow the remaining rural drivers to pick up more people and make more money for less work. Pyber Pool would be automatically selected for rides under $5 or pay an additional fee to not use Pyber Pool. The final suggestion is to redo the report and find the times across all city types where fares are the lowest and reduce the number of drivers during those times.
